        <h2 id="1">Introduction</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
        	Life is unpredictable. We all go about our own lives with problems and surprises popping up here and there. When we face such situations, our mental energy is sucked away and drastically reduced, leading to an unhealthy, ineffective, and unhappy lifestyle. However, there are always two things are under our control, and that is nothing other than our own minds, and the present moment. Therefore, in this article, I will be sharing with you 2 tools, that are free, convenient, and could possible turn your life upside down, and assure that the present moment, and your mind, are fully under your control.
        </p>

        <h2 id="2">Meditation</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
        	For hundreds and thousands of years, meditation has been used to study the consciousness of humans. The word “Buddha” means “enlightenment” or “the awakened one”; Buddha, isn’t a god, but a mortal who’d achieved enlightenment throughout meditation and mindfulness practices. Buddhists practice meditation for we believe that it is the path to enlightenment and inner peace and joy. But even if you’re not Buddhist, Meditation is the path to a successful and enjoyable life
        </p>

        <h3 id="3">How can you benefit?</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
        	It is essentially true- meditation is the key to happiness, inner liberty, success and wisdom. There are many benefits of consistently meditating and it may vary on one’s circumstances, concentration and commitment. The following are a few outcomes that exponentially changed the way I think, act, and live, by meditating every single day:
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li style="background-color: #ffebcd;">Increases focus and attention</li><br>
        	<li style="background-color: #ffebcd;">Gives the ability to cope with stress, anxiety 
             and worries.
        	</li><br>
        	<li style="background-color: #ffebcd;">Gratitude and appreciation.</li><br>
        	<li style="background-color: #ffebcd;">Helps discover the subtle sensations of the physical body</li><br>
        </ul>
        <p>
        	Firstly, heightened focus.<br>
            In today’s world, due to the flexibility and ease to consume information anywhere anytime, our minds are constantly wandering- our consciousnesses are drifting uncontrollably: when we are supposed to focus on work, we get distracted and think about the video of a rainbow cat we saw all the way back in 2011, while we are actually doing our work. We don’t notice it, because we aren’t mindful. This is when meditation comes in, and in my experience, meditation is equivalent to hiring apowerful hero to kick away unwanted thoughts, and center your attention back to what really matters.
        </p>
        <p>
        	My mind wanders a lot when I go about my normal day. I pay attention when I have to, but only to a certain extent and I often find myself lost in thoughts, imaginations and anticipations. By focusing on each in-breath and out-breath, and observing thoughts and feelings, I have been cultivating a sharper sense of awareness in my daily life, and overtime I’ve built up a mindful consciousness which allows me to notice that if I am wondering about unnecessary thoughts, I can deliberately notify myself to focus on the present moment.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Secondly,it helps deal with stress, anxiety, and overthinking.<br>
        	My entire life, I have always been anxious when it comes to nerve-wrecking events,
        	or events with uncertain outcomes. Like I mentioned above, I anticipate worst case scenarios, worry about what could happen, and totally forget that only the present moment is in my control. But meditation turns things around. It re-centers me in the present. It reminds me to let go of what I can’t control, and to focus on things that are within my reach. Of course, it is impossible to deplete all negative emotions, but meditation allows me to acknowledge that they exist, find the root cause, and if the place where the problem roots is fixable, and within my control, I’ll do my best to get rid of it, and if it is the opposite, I’ll just, let it be.
        </p>
        <p>
        	And by doing so, I can become more joyful, and appreciative of how well things are going under my control, as well as let go of cravings, greed and the sensation of wanting more and being a perfectionist. This brings us to the third, profound, benefit of meditation: gratitude and appreciation.
        </p>
        <p>
        	There is one particular type of meditation which emphasizes on gratefulness and appreciation, called Gratitude Meditation. For a certain period of time, it makes us think of the things and people we have around us, and imagine what our life would be without them. By doing so, we can cultivate a deeper sense of appreciation for their existence. The feeling of gratitude feels superb. I can’t describe the feeling vividly, and specifically, but it is heartwarming. When we become grateful we let go of craving, dissatisfaction, and become engulfed in the present moment with happiness, peace, and liberty.

        </p>
        <p>
        	Last but not least, it enables us to become more aware of our physical sensations, like aches, subtle movements of muscles, and so on. There is a type of meditation that is in my favor, which is called the “Body Scan”. While practicing this certain type of meditation, my consciousness have to scan from head to toe, or toe to head-every subtle movement in my body. I enjoy this particular type of mindfulness practice, since I can become more aware of discomfort and pain within my physical existence.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The best use of the “Body Scan” method would be when you are feeling extreme discomfort or pain in your body. I tried to implement it when I had a high fever; my body felt heavy, my head was aching and my overall temperature was rising. I tried my best to focus on each subtle pain and discomfort, and surprisingly for a short while, my pain was eased. There are many other types of meditations as well as many other benefits and bonus points you can gain from meditation. But, how do you actually start meditating? It’s fairly simple, let me explain.
        </p>
        
        <h3 id="4">How to start meditating</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
        	Meditation isn’t a complex and tiring skill to pick up, as well as arguably easy. As I’ve mentioned above, there are many types of meditation. I’ll be keeping this section relatively short, since you can uncover more concerning with how to meditate if you use narrative meditation apps like Medito.
        </p>
        <p>
        	I would like to mention about the most simple and conventional way of meditating.You might have heard of this type of meditation if you are a Buddhist or have practiced Yoga. Basically, you just focus on your breath.... as you inhale and exhale.It’s that simple; the simplest type of meditation!
        </p>
        <p>
        	All sorts of meditations’ requisite is to focus on one thing in particular- for instance,Body Scan meditation makes you focus on your physical sensations, whereby, Mantra Meditation enables you to follow along the flow of a Mantra. Overall, you can practice whatever type of meditation best suits your state- mentally or physically. The message I want to give here is that some people think meditation is frustrating and energy consuming; that is true, if you’re just a beginner, but with patience, you can practice daily and eventually, it will become much more easier to guide your attention to one thing in particular

        </p>
        <h2 id="5">Journaling</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>
        	Let’s move on to Journaling, now,shall we? I bet that we’ve probably heard of Journaling or keeping diaries. Journaling is the best way of noting down your thoughts, feelings, events and actions in your life. If you go and ask a YouTuber likeHamza, or IceCold JT, how to deal with stress, overthinking, they’d probably tell you to write it down, in a journal- it’s that powerful! Just like meditation, there are many approaches to journaling as well as beneficial outcomes. Firstly, let’s start with the rewards it grants.
        </p>

        <h3 id="6">Beneficial Outcomes</h3>
        <p>
        	It’s been about 3+ months, since I’ve started journaling. In my notebook, I have about 100+ entries, and I’ve never missed a single day. Throughout the past 3-4 months of writing down my thoughts and daily actions in my journal, I learnt many things about myself, as well as reflected on my thoughts. The first benefit of journaling I want to talk about is something that seems obvious, which is Mental Clarity

        </p>
        <p>
        	By writing down what you are thinking in your mind- positive or negative thoughts-you can get a clear picture of what is going on inside your head. Meditationis also based on the approach of getting a clearer picture of your thoughts and feelings.Likewise, you can also write down what your inner voice has been telling you, take a step back, read it again, and then figure out the solution to the problem you are facing
        </p>
        <p>
        	This approach enabled me to get writing ideas, stories to tell, and how to manage
my habits, school life and so on. Whenever something that resonates with me comes
to mind, I’ll write it down and if it is something great that happened to me or an
excellent idea I’d came up with, I’ll try my best to cherish it or implement it. If it is
something bad, I will try to read it and think about it for some time and figure out the
solutions to the problem I am facing.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Secondly, journaling brings you gratitude.There is a particular type of journaling solely based on gratitude and appreciation-just like meditation. There are many ways to dabble with gratitude journaling. You can have a separate book to write down things you are grateful for daily (or a section for that) or you can just write a whole entry based on the things that happened to you which you appreciate.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Last but not least, Journaling stores memories. Memories are very important in our lives; whether good or bad, our past actions contribute to who we are now. Thereby, having a system to store your actions and events in your life can be a huge benefit for you, since you can look back at what happened to you in the past specifically in the future.
        </p>
        <h3 id="7">How to get started with journaling</h3>
        <hr/>
        <p>Now, the question that most of you might have been wondering about. “How do you get into journaling?”. Well, just as people think meditation isn’t easy to pick up, the majority of us also thinks journaling wastes time and thinks it’s hard to write down your thoughts. Of course, I’ve been in a situation where I stare at an blank paper andno ideas come out of my mind- but I didn’t say no to writing that day’s entry!So, just write
</p>     
          <p>
          	 Here’s how you can do that: stare at a blank wall with a pen and paper in your hands; continue staring at the wall until you have a basic idea of what you have been thinking and what you want to write down in your journal. Once again, it’s that simple!
          </p>
          <p>
          	 My personal approach, is to think about what I would want to write ahead- meaning, that when I have free time in the day, I would think about what I have been dealing with in my life. If I don’t make time for that, I just stare at the wall or the blank page until I get a gist of what to note down.
          </p>
          <p>
          	 I’d also want to advice you to keep 2 journals,once you’ve reached quite the destination in your journaling journey, and think that you are ready for it.The first journal is just for reflecting your thoughts, how you have been behaving, how you have been treating others and etc. The second one is like a diary, or a daily record; you just write down the events in bulleted lists (similar to bullet journals) and write about what you think of them.
          </p>
          <h3 id="8">Conclusion+ Summary</h3>
          <hr/>
          <p>
          	 Now, we’ve reached the end of the post. I hope you’ve got a basic grasp regarding of meditation and journaling, which can aid you in leading a happy, healthy, productive life. Just like the opening quote states, you can use Journaling and Meditation, as tools to help you become more aware of your struggles and problems, and spark solutions, new ideas, and to ultimately motivate yourself to do something great! My overall advice is to just get started, and consistently keep up the work. Thank you all for reading, peace out
