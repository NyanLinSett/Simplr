      <h3>The Investigation</h3>
      <p>All human beings procrastinate. Procrastinating doesn’t just apply on things thathave 
      	 to do with productivity. I believe that we all procrastinate on whatever that takes effort and whatever that doesn’t grant instant rewards. Some people may think thatprocrastination is just a minor problem, but in truth, it could be considered one ofyour greatest foes-which lie within your soul-that you will ever face throughout yourjourney of life.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 The all-in-one answer to “Why do we procrastinate?” would be because we are humans. As humans we have varied thoughts, feelings and emotions. It is alsohuman nature that we don’t want to do things that appear to be energy consuming,things that appear to be boring and things that appear to have delayed rewards.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 Let us imagine a situation. Picture that you just received an abrupt motivation spike.Your mind feels awakened, you feel fresh and active, and your imagination is full ofideas and aspirations and you can’t wait to take action. In this situation let’s say thatyou are inspired to start writing a blog. So you get onto the internet, to learn abouthow to start a blog. At the moment, you are very determined to absorb the abundantknowledge, so you refuse to procrastinate. For some time, you learn about how tostart a blog. But then your own mind starts betraying you. Thoughts that oppose yourgoal of starting a blog will arise with strong evidence. And as those thoughts accrete,you will start to lose hope that you cannot reach your goal.  The next day, afterthinking for a while, you succeed in persuading yourself to try again. But this time, assoon as you turn on your pc, you are surronded by temptations. Notifications afternotifications, new videos on YouTube, games and so on. You can’t resist, and so youdecide to play a game, and then another game, and maybe 3 or 4 videos onYouTube and finally the day is over.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 We can break down this story into tiny parts and we can investigate the causes ofprocrastination.
      </p>

      <h3>Do Not Rely on Motivation</h3>
      <p>
      	The bell which rang and alerted you was a motivation spike. Motivation is the firstcause of procrastination. Now you may wonder, isn’t motivation necessary to beatprocrastination? Well, yes. But the problem with motivation is that it is veryspontaneous and occurs very sporadically. Sometimes you may receive motivationspikes and you may have the energy to study for 3 hours straight, sometimes youmay have the energy to write 20 pages in 2 hours, and sometimes you have nomotivation to even get out of bed. This is not what we want. We need long termsustainability. We need the energy to keep working and keep fighting for our wholelives. Many people believe that they lack motivation and that is preventing them frombeing productive. However this convention is not true. Motivation is often overrated.If motivation is not reliable and untrustworthy, then how can we overcome thecompulsive urge of procrastination?
      </p>

      <h3>Long term sustainability: System emphasis</h3>
      <p>
      	 Everyone has their own goals. The goals may vary from “I want to lose weight by theend of the year” or “I want to quit video game addiction” and so on. It’s great to beambitious. The clearer and more visible your goal is, the more likely you are toachieve it. But goal setting doesn’t quite fit with what we are aiming for: long termsustainability. You may have studied 8 hours a day and then got A+ for all yoursubjects, but that isn’t our exact priority. You did keep the habit of studying 8 hours aday for your finals, but after you’ve achieved your big red A+ on your report card,there is no longer a milestone to work for. To keep the productive blood flowing andenergy producing we have to focus on systems. Rather than writing down hundredsof goals on your New Year’s Resolutions-though it’s a great thing to do- it is muchmore effective to give time to design and architect your systems for when you work.You can use this method called Identity based habit change- from Atomic Habits.Bluntly, instead of focusing on what you want, you focus on who you want tobecome. This makes it easier to complete collections of habits that cast votestowards the identity you wish to achieve, which in other words, your systems.
      </p>

      <h3>Evidence feedback loop</h3>
      <p>
      	In our story, your own mind started feeding you thoughts that oppose your final goal.This process is called the “Evidence feedback loop”. “Evidence feedback loop” takesaction when the certain task you have to accomplish have great difficulties. Just likeits name, whenver put in a situation where you have to use great amount ofconcentration and energy, your subconscious mind will start debating with yourconscious mind. It will marshal all the data which contains evidence that opposesyour conscious mind’s dedication. The stronger and more frequent the evidence is,the likelier that you will procrastinate. And as these evidential thoughts repeat, youwill start to lose hope, leading to procrastination. Whatever you do, difficulties liewithin. Even if you’ve been a student for 8 years, you will still have difficultiesstudying for your finals, because each year, the amout of information you have toabsorb increases. This is worse when you try and learn new things that you havenever done before. Because you don’t have experience with the problems andstumbling blocks that you will have to face on this journey, the “Evidence feedbackloop” is more likely to occur.
      </p>

      <h3>How do we counter “Evidence feedback loop”?</h3>
      <p>
      	The best solution to “Evidence feedback loop” is obvious. With our information, weknow that our subconscious mind is the foremost cause of “Evidence feedback loop”,because it brings out inversed information of what we want to do. To prevent this, wehave to prepare our mind beforehand. Before we take our first step, we have toexamine and investigate the obstacles which we will face on the way. By doing this,we will be aware of the difficulties, but in a positive way so that we can decode ourproblems and then find a way to reach the end goal. This is possibly the hardest andmost energy consuming technique, because you have to be aware of what you arefeeding your subconscious mind 24/7 and you have to be mulling over your mind allthe time. This is also a very crucial step when battling against procrastinationbecause our beliefs play an essential role in our behavior and habits.
      </p>

      <h3>Environment is essential</h3>
      <p>
      	 We all think that procrastination has to do with only our inner lives. But in reality, thethings we surrond ourselves with also play a major role in behavior change-just likein the Tale of Two Birds. Looking back at our story, you may notice how yourenvironment increased the chances of procrastination. Distractions were very easilyaccessible, additionally you experienced “Evidence feedback loop” and so theprocrastination rate was 100%. Steven Pressfield, the author of The War of Art,states that we live in “the consumer culture”. Nowadays, it is very easy to get yourhands on casual entertainment tools such as Televisions, Mobiles, Laptops and soon. The easier it is to get your hands on something very tempting, the more likelythat you are going to procrastinate. Not just things, people you hang out with areaffect your behaviors. If you hang out with a group of people that procrastinate a lot,there is also a high chance that you are going to procrastinate because you can’tvisibly percept why it is bad to procrastinate. Conversely, if you surrond yourself withfellows who have good habits, you will also adapt to the way they speak, believe andact and gradually you will start to want good habits and behaviors.
      </p>

      <h3>Becoming the architect of our environment</h3>
      <p>
      	 A small change in what you see shifts in what you do. We can use this principle toarchitect our environment so that what we percept will help us create and work moreefficiently. It is actually simple and easy to prime your environment to maximize yourproductivity. Make items associated with good habits more visible and make itemsassociated with bad habits less visible. If you want to read more, put the book youwant to read where you mostly roam around-living room, your bed or desk. If youwant to stop getting distracted while you’re working, get rid of the things that disturbsyou-games, phone, social media and etc,. It is very practical to think that you usuallyscroll on your phone for hours on end while you are laying on your bed because it isassociated with the mood that your bed provides- the comfort and privacy.Conversely, we can redesign our workspace so that it puts you in the mood forproductive work. Declutter your drawers and only put what is necessary for yourwork. Get rid of distractions and add little things that make your place look moreattractive and fun to work at.<br> I also mentioned that who you hang out with also plays a major role in behavior change. James Clear states in his newsletter as follow:
      </p>
      <p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 3px solid black;">“One of the best strategies for learning something quickly: corner a nerd.
            Find someone who totally geeks out about that topic and ask them every questionyou can  think of.”
      </p>
      </p>
      <p>
      	 We can use this idea to reformat our belief system. We can hang out with peoplewho have mastered the techniques of overcoming procrastination, we can followsuccessful people and listen to their life stories. What I think is more efficient ishanging out with amateurs who share the same goals with ourselves. On thejourney, everyone can learn together, and share rookie mistakes. All in all, ourenvironment and people we spend time with can help us in improving to becomingbetter people and vise versa.
      </p>

      <h3>Procrastination isn’t always bad</h3>
      <p>
      	Procrastination is a really fearsome foe that we all fear for it has many harmfuleffects but procrastination isn’t always bad. There are actually some surprising benefits of procrastination which help us in some ways.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 In 1967, the Alternative Uses Test proved that procrastination isn’t always bad.Three groups were assigned to name alternative uses for certain objects, but theywould only give their answer after a 10 minutes break. During the 10 minutes break,the first group was allotted to complete hard tasks, the second group did nothing and the third group had to solve simple problems. This experiment resulted with the thirdgroup producing 40% more unusual uses than the other two. The reason is that yoursubconscious mind is trying to solve problems while your conscious mind isoccupied with other light tasks. So the next time you feel stressed and tired becauseyou can’t do anything productive, then take the time to do what you enjoy. One thingthat is important is that we have to do something not very distractive and somethingthat helps you relax-reading a book, talking to a friend or family member, going for awalk and so on. Not only that procrastination helps you take things slowly andreminds you to enjoy the beauty of the present. Rather than having a fixed attentionon the future and upcoming events, it is very essential for us to enjoy what we havecurrently for our spiritual wellbeing. It also helps us spend our time doing what welove and reduces our stress level hence has a positive impact on our mental health.
      </p>
      <p>
      	 Overall, procrastination is something that you have to intentionally defeat becauseone act of procrastination can derail your progress of good habits. On the otherhand, it isn’t always bad, so we have to be very careful with when and when not toprocrastinate. I hope this article helped widen your view and knowledge withprocrastination. There are many things that were not uncovered in this article but Istrongly believe that it helped you someway somehow. Thank you for reading thisuntil the very end. I wish you all healthy, happy and productive lives.
