	<h3 id="1">Introduction</h3>
	<p>Habits encompass our lifestyles. Our thoughts define our actions. Our actions
become our behaviors. Our behaviors, with enough repetition, become habits. Habits
define the way we think, the way we act and the way we behave. With that being
said, our habits relate with everything in life, in some sort of aspect. Habits and
behaviors differ each and one of us’ traits and personalities and vise versa. He
whom is considered kind, compassionate and is innately hardworking is one with
excellent habits. In this post, you are going to learn about the basic things you need
to know in building great habits, and breaking bad ones.</p>

    <h3 id="2">Step 1: Taking the correct route</h3>
    <p>When fine actions become habits, they will have certain outcomes too. Perhaps, you
       are reading this because you’ve heard of how building good habits had changed the lives of many. Before starting your journey of habit accumulation, it is essential to take the correct path. Fascinated by the results, it is extremely easy to skip steps and start from an advanced stage. There is no shortcut of succeeding in anything. Starting from an advanced stage can seem tiring and generally your effort is being wasted. Choosing the right habit and putting in the necessary work is energy saving and will serve you with greater outcomes than working your butt off, starting at a seemingly higher stage just to obtain the results faster. When it comes to choosing the right habits to start with, there are 2 things you must keep in mind.</p>

    <h5 style="padding-left: 10px;">1. Focus on “who” you want to become, not “what” you want to achieve.</h5>
    <h5 style="padding-left: 10px;">2. The habits you choose must align with you intrinsic capibilities.</h5>

    <h3 id="3"> 1. Focus on “who” you want to become, not “what” you want to achieve.</h3>
    <p>When we set out to build good habits, there is one particular mistake that the
       majority makes. That is focusing on Goals rather than Systems. Goals restrict
       happiness. Sure, we may have set out goals to “get an A+ in the Maths exam” or
       “finish the article by Sunday”. We all think to ourselves “I’ll be able to relax when my
       article gets published by Sunday,” and “I’ll celebrate with my friends after my Maths
       test results come out,” The truth is, after accomplishing certain achievements, there
       is nothing left except to celebrate the rewards. Life isn’t over yet and daily challenges
       will continue to come. Setting goals help us get a clear direction of where to go, but
       only, momentarily for the goal itself.</p>
       <p>However, by focusing on “who” (identity) rather than “what” (goals) we are able to
       produce great results while maintaining good habits in the long run. We were not
       born with preset beliefs. Our habits, actions and decisions we make shape who we
       are. The more we repeat a habit, the more it becomes associated with our identities.</p>
       <p>Habits tend to have a compounded reward system rather than a reward-after-action
       system. Humanity have been stuck with the reward-after-action system since the
       Paleolithic era. Back in the Stone Age, food was scarce and hunting was the only
       way to eat and live. After knocking an animal out, dinner would be ready. The reward
       would come right after the action. There were no “goals” or nothing, but we have
       evolved to the point of long term sustainability. Since we inherited the behaviors from
       our ancestors, we still have the human tendency of wanting something right away
       after certain actions. We can defy such natural temptations by focusing on our
       Identity rather than the Reward.</p>

       	  <h5> 1. Outcomes</h5>
                 <h5> 2. Process</h5>
                 <h5> 3. Identity (as in the first figure)</h5>
                 <h5>from: <a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">Atomic Habits by James Clear</a></h5>
       </p>
       <h5>Concisely, habits shape our identities, and vise versa.</h5>
       <ul>
       	  <li>If you are someone who wakes up at 5 a.m, goes to the gym and workout for at least 30 minutes everyday, you embody the identity of a healthy person. And since you embody the identity of a healthy person, you are someone who works hard to achieve a healthy lifestyle i.e. someone who works out at 5 a.m everyday.
          </li>
          <li>If you are someone who studies 5 hours a day, write 5000 words every week and gets A+ every exam, you embody the identity of an industrious student. And since you embody the identity of a studious leaner, you are someone whostudies and reviews the lesson everyday after class.</li>
       </ul>

       <h3 id="4"> Reward systems to help you keep winning</h3>
       <p>Feeling successful, being rewarded even by small means, boosts morality and enhances work efficiency. However, since habits tend to have a compounded reward system, with a delayed delivery, how can we keep resisting to maintain motivation tokeep working hard for such outcomes? The foremost cause of giving up to build good habits is not because of the high rate of failure, but boredom. Humans tend to get bored easily when the outcomes become expected and are no longer having exciting impact.
       </p>

       <h3 id="5">Temptation Bundling</h3>
       <p>
       	  In life, we get to do things, and we have to do things. In our situation, the habit is what we have to do, and something we like is what we get to do. By combining these two, we can create something called Temptation Bundling.
       </p>
       <p>
       	  After [HABIT I HAVE TO DO] I will [HABIT YOU WANT TO DO](source-<a href="https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">Atomic Habits by James Clear)</a>
       </p>
       <p>
       	  The important thing to keep in mind is that an external reward granted by Temptation Bundling, is only for motivation’s sake, the focus should be on the process, the habit itself. You must avoid rewards that conflict with your desired identity. e.g. If you are building habits to become a successful student your rewards can’t be “Binge watch a Netflix show.”
       </p>
       <p>
       	  Additionally, we can also create variable rewards. If the habit you want to do gets boring or doesn’t fit in with what you have to do, the chances of doing what you must do, will also be reduced. Since life isn’t always the same everyday, we can create different kinds of rewards for different kinds of situations. The objective is to switch a reward with something else when it gets boring, so that performing a certain habit will grant great outcomes consistently
       </p>

       <h3 id="6"> 2. The habits you choose must align with your intrinsic capibilities</h3>
       <p>
       	   As I have stated earlier, choosing the wrong habit will lead to an extremely tiring and energy consuming journey. It is essential to know what you are good at. Pick the right habit and life is easy, pick the wrong one and life is a struggle. The secret to success is knowing where to compete and win. Competence is highly dependent on context. We have heard of successful athletes like Michael Phelps or Shaquille O'Neal. They both have amazing and unique bodies, rich stamina and great mindsets. The secret to their great athletic successes is because they knew that they had great talent in sports. Shaquille O’Neal would be able to score excellent points in a basketball game, but not so many in a Math Olympiad.
        </p>
        <p>
        	The key takeaway here is to find out which field you would top at. Just because you don’t have talent for starting a successful enterprise, that doesn’t mean you can’t write a best sellers’ book. Genetic support is crucial, but they do not determine you destiny, rather areas of opportunity and success.
        </p>

        <h3 id="7">How to find a game worth playing</h3>
        <p>
        	In the beginning of every new activity, there is an Exploration Phase, where you would discover possibilities, different outcomes and ideas. After exploring various areas, and once you have narrowed down the subjects you’re good at, the best solution is to focus all your energy on it. The balance depends on whether you’re winning or losing. If you keep winning, keep Exploiting, if you’re not doing very well, constantly keep exploring, if it works, exploit, if it doesn’t, move on and explore.
        </p>
        <p>This process is known as Explore and Exploit.</p>
        <p>To make this process easier, here is a list of questions you can ask yourself.</p>
        <ol>
        	<li><p>What feels like fun to me, but work to others?</p></li>
        	<li><p>What makes me lose track of time?</p></li>
        	<li><p>Where do I get greater returns than the average person?</p></li>
        	<li><p>What comes naturally to me?</p></li>
        </ol>

        <p>There is also another principle which is relatively similar with Exploit and Explore. </p>

        <div style=" border-left: 3px black solid; padding: 20px; "> “The illiterate of the 21st century will not be those who cannot read and write, but those who cannot learn, unlearn, and relearn.”- <b>Alvin Toffler </b>
        </div>

        <img src="habits1.png">

        <p>There isn’t just one definite answer i.e. perspective to a subject. You have to 1. Learn, when a new idea that conflicts comes up, 2. Unlearn the first one and compare. Choose the one which appears to have strong evidence and relearn.
        </p>

        <p>
        	 The main focus of these 2 principles is to help you explore until you find an area, an idea that you think would truly suit you. Even after you find it, you should keep exploring and learning and unlearning and relearning. My advice is to not just build habits that cast votes towards your identity, but also ones that appears interesting to you. Just because your desired identity is to become a doctor, it doesn’t mean you shouldn’t build a habit of making concept art. The broader knowledge you have, the more creative and new ideas you can come up with.
        </p>
            <hr/>
        <h3 id="8"> Step 2: Scaling down</h3>
        <p>
        	As you have read in the first step, it is very easy to get prompted to start big. You may have heard of terms like: take baby steps, slow and steady wins the race and so on. Never start too big; it’s extremely easy to get convinced to start with a big task due to motivation and excitement. Such actions have drawbacks like wasting energy and time, inefficiency and minor, atomic decreases in your motivation level.
        </p>

        <h3 id="9"> The underrated power of 1%</h3>
        <p>
        	Whenever starting a new activity or process, the importance is to remember that you have to walk slowly, but never backwards. We think that massive success requires massive action, but in truth, massive success comes from accumulation of small, tiny 1% wins. Within the overlooked areas lie so much little details which can lead you to victory.

        </p>
        <p>
        	As I mentioned above, habits have a compounded reward system. In other words,
            good habits come from small unnoticeable habits. The importance is to keep in mind is that improving by small means is not noticeable but has a huge impact on your lifelong journey.
        </p>
          <img src="habits3.png">
        <p style="background-color: whitesmoke; padding: 20px">
        	1% worse every day for one year. 0.99^365= 00.03
        	1% better every day for one year. 1.01^365= 37.78
        	<a href="https://www.jamesclear.com/atomic-habits" target="_blank">From Atomic Habits by James Clear</a>
        </p>

        <p>
        	With that being said, below are some methods you can follow along to accrete minor wins.
        </p>

        <h3 id="10">1.  2 Minutes rule</h3>

        <p>The 2 minutes rule is just as it sounds; if it takes less than 2 minutes, don’t hesitate, just do it. If it takes more than 2 minutes, however, redesign it so that it will take less than 2 minutes.</p>

        <p>That sounded quite confusing. Let me explain.</p>

        <p>After you have chosen a habit that aligns with your identity and innate abilities, you must think if it takes less than 2 minutes to do. The objective is to build a “gateway” habit- as author James Clear states. Make it easy to start and the rest will follow.</p>

        <p>
        	For example, If you want to read a book, try your best to pay full attention for the very first two minutes. If you’re still interested, keep on the pace. However, if you have lost interest, get up and do something else. The emphasis is to build the consistency of reading for two minutes. As those two minutes reading gradually compile, you will build a habit of sitting down, opening your book and reading. After you have mastered the art of showing up to read, the rest of the process will take care of itself.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Exhaustively, scale down your habits as much as possible. Make your habits easy to complete. Then, gradually build up the weight. Standardization before optimization.
        </p>

        <h3 id="11"> When to level up</h3>
        <p>
        	Starting off small is a crucial step to take, but you can’t just stay there forever. At some point, you must scale up your habits. Habits are exciting right at the beginning, but as time passes, and they become repeated, they become less exciting and interesting. The chances of repeating the habits decline when they are no longer novel. When this happens, it is the cue that you must scale up your habits. Here’s some ways you can do that:
        </p>
        <ul>
        	<li>Focus on the smaller portion of your small version of your habits, remember the importance of small wins.
        	</li><br>
        	<li>Scale up, switch up the game, make it harder, but align with your currentcapibilities.
        	</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        	Human motivation level peaks when the task at hand is just of manageable energy-midpoint of the specturm, not too easy, not too hard. This principle helps us tackle with habits easier. Scale it up so that you have to pour in a little bit more effort, but not too difficult so that it won’t be very tiring.
        </p>
       
       <h3 id="12">2.  2 Days Rule</h3>
       <p>	  
       	  The 2 days rule also follow a similar structure, but is simpler. It is important to take breaks. They help us relax our minds, enjoy the time we have and slow things down. Thus, you must take a break for 1 day once in a while, but never 2. Not just for intentional breaks, whenever you feel like “maybe just a day off”, and then it adds up to 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days, you must always remember to abide by the 2 days rule.
       </p>
       <p>
       	  Never break the chain, consistency is important. Even if you did lose the streak, never let the hiatus continue.
       </p>

       <p style="background-color: whitesmoke; padding: 20px; "> I found out about the “2 days rule” on Matt D’avella’s channel. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bfLHTLQZ5nc&t=3s">Check out 
       	  the full video here. </a>
       </p>

       <h3 id="13">3. Implementation Intentions</h3>
       <p>Just as we write New Years Resolutions, to set visible goals, it is also 
       	  important to make sure that you know how you would implement your habits; when and where.
       </p>
       <p>Implementation Intentions Formula:</p>
       <p>I will [BEHAVIOR] at [TIME] in [LOCATION].</p>
       <p>Implementation Intention enables your habits to stick to certain times and places as well as increases the efficiency rate of your habits. Time and Environment plays an essential role in behavior change. It is crucial to know when and where to act.
       </p>
            <hr/>
       <h3 id="14"> Step 3: Priming the Environment</h3>	
       <div style=" border-left: 3px black solid; padding: 20px;">
         A small change in what you see, shifts what you do. - <b> James Clear </b>
      </div>
       <p>Every habit is initiated by a cue. The more visible a cue is, the higher the chance it will prompt a certain habit. An environment, an item, a mood, a feeling, a sensation, a perception, is associated with a habit. Perhaps, it is the comfort and coziness of the bed which causes you to lay down and scroll on your phone for hours. Or it may be the feeling that your writing desk provides, which prompts you to write down hundreds and thousands of words. One thing we surely know, is that our environments have huge impacts on behavior and habits.
       </p>
       <p>
       	   The main objective of “Priming the Environment”, is simple and easy to follow:Make the things you want to access often more visible and make the ones that have not so pleasing results- yet you tend to use frequently- invisible.
       </p>

       For exmple-
       <ul>
       	   <li>
       	   	   You want to read more at night, but your phone is distracting you, lock your phone away somewhere and turn off notifications. In the daytime, put a book by your bedside. Once you get into bed at night, your phone should be away and there will be a book ready to be read.
           </li>
           <li>
           	   You want to eat fruits when you feel hungry, but you appear to snack on things like chips and crisps more. Move the chips and crisps to somewhere you don’t go quite often in the kitchen -alternatively, do not buy any snacks at the grocery and make sure to leave the fruits on somewhere obvious, like on the dining table. So when you’re hungry, you’re more likely to eat the fruits which are easier to access.
           </li>
       </ul>

       	   Environment Redesign worked very efficiently for me.<br/>After my morning writing sessions everyday (from 9 AM to 10 AM), I usually like to pick up my phone -which would usually be placed next to my laptop- and scroll through TikTok and Instagram for about 30 minutes, until the voice inside me yells out “It’s been 30 minutes”. To tackle with this problem, before I start writing, at about 8:45 AM, I make sure to lock my phone away in my drawer. Eve though it was just a small alteration, this tiny change in environment prevented me from using social media for too long early in the morning.

       <h3 id="15"> Friction and Environment</h3>
       <p>The more friction associated with a habit, the likelier than it will be left undone. Habits are easier to build when they fit into the flow of life. Too often, we try to build habits in a high friction environment. The solution to this problem is to reduce the amount of friction associated with a habit, or more ideally, to completely get rid of the friction. To reduce friction- or to get rid of it entirely- we must redesign our environments so that when we step inside it, we will be welcomed by a flawless workstation, with nothing preventing you from being productive.
       </p>
       <p>
       	  There is usually a variety of habits involved in one big habit. Take writing for example. Even though there isn’t much there are still a few steps required to get to writing. You have to take out your pen and paper, or you have to turn on your computer and launch your Notion or Microsoft Word. You have to prepare the material, take notes and constantly think of what should go into your final product. 
       </p>
       <p>
       	   Priming environment helps reducing friction- so that every time you want to completea one big habit, you wouldn’t have to manually go through the little actions that are required.
       </p>

       For exemple-
           <ul>
           	   <li>Make your <a href="www.notion.so" target="_blank">Notion</a> auto launch when you turn on your pc.</li><br/>
           	   <li>Have your book and pen on the desk beforehand.</li><br/>
           	   <li>Prepare the ingredients you are willing to cook the next day, a 
           	   	   night  before.
           	   </li><br/>
           	   <li>If you want to meditate more, set up a comfortable and quite place  
           	   	   which you can access easily.
               </li><br/>
           </ul>


        <p>
        	By priming your environment and reducing friction, you will be able to automate your habits and it will be easier to repeat in the future.
       </p>
       <h3 id="16"> How Social Environment relates with habits</h3>
       <p>
       	  Through genetics, we inherited behaviors and habits from our parents. We don’t only derive and copy behaviors through genetics; but also through the groups, the tribes we belong to. This applies to any sort of group you fall into. Whether that’d be large ones like nations, religions and businesses or small groups like friends, family and neighborhood.<br/> The foremost cause of why we humans -whether consciously or unconsciously- copy
          the habits of the people around us, is because we have a sense of belonging. We want to feel natural, together and aligned with who we are- just like in our childhood fairy tale: the tale of the two birds. When we are living day to day, surrounded by people who have certain habits, it feels natural to repeat these habits because it is conventional. It’s similar with Identity Based Habit Change, but in a larger portion. We want to embody the Identity of a Group. Therefore, we naturally soak up the habits of those around us.
       </p>
       
       	  
       <ul>
       	   <li>
       	   	   If you have a group of friends who do underage dating, you might be tempted to fall in love at a young age as well.

       	   </li>
       	   <li>
       	   	   If you’ve joined a book club with people who reads 20 pages a day, you will also slowly build up the habit of reading.

       	   </li>
       	   <li>
       	   	   If most of your family members are vegan, there’s also a high chance that you will grow up to be a vegetarian.
           </li>
       </ul>

       <p>Since we now know how Social Environment influences behavior, we can use it 
           toour advantage.</p>


        <p>
        	The objective is simple: become apart of a group where your desired habit, actions and behaviors are the norm.

        <h3 id="17"> My Favorite Tools for Habit Sustainability</h3>
        <h4 id="18">1.  Habit Tracker</h4>
        <p>
        	Just like the External Reward Systems, Habit Trackers provide motivation while the compounding outcomes of habits accrete. The most effective form of motivation is progress. Habit tracking helps you see your progress easily, it is satisfying and it enables us to focus on the progress rather than the goal.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Habit Tracking is easy, just write down a list of habits you wish to complete. And as soon as you finish those certain habits tick them out. One thing to note is that you must track your habits right after you complete it. The downside of habit tracking is you must consciously adapt the habit of tracking. Habit Tracking has to be automated. Another thing I wanted to mention is you don’t need to buy a fancy habit tracker- unless you’re really dedicated or just have plenty of money to burn. Any type and form of habit tracking works, as long as you can see your progress easily. I use my old physics notebook, but a calendar, a Notion template or a piece of paper will do the job.
        </p>
        <p>
        	Habit Tracking is really effective for me, personally. After I take out my habit tracker for the last time before I go to bed, I write down why I couldn’t complete certain habits. It helps me reflect on what I did wrong and how I can improve next time.
        </p>

        <h4 id="19">2.  Journaling</h4>
        <p>Speaking of daily reflection, journaling is a great way of reflecting your daily life. Ever since I discovered journaling, I have never stopped doing it. Before I go to bed, at around 9:30-9:40, I jot down stuff in my leather-cover notebook. Random ideas, things I did, stuff I’m grateful for and my future plans. There is no rule with journaling. But one thing I discovered throughout my journaling process is that, sometimes you might want to just write 3 sentences, sometimes 2 pages; set yourself a daily limit. For me, I try my best to write at least one page a day. Never less than one page, and never more than one page, so that I genuinely get most of the things out of my mind but also to not turn my journal into a long ass article.</p>

        <h2 id="20"> Summary+ Conclusion</h2>
