    <h2>What is Minimalism?</h2>

    <p> Let's define minimalism.</p>

    <p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 3px solid black; "><mark style="background-color: #fef5df ;">“Minimalism is not a lack of something. It’s simply the perfect amount of something.” -Nicholas Burroughs </mark></p>

    <p>Minimalism is about more than just possessions, though.  Minimalism is focusing on and committing to the fundamentals, instead of wasting time, money, or energy on details.</p>

    <p>Committing to the basics and mastering the fundamentals can be hard, though.</p>

    <p>In the words of my friend,<a href="https://twitter.com/CorbettBarr" > Corbett Barr </a>, people waste too much time debating edge cases. Edge cases are the what-ifs, the could-bes, the minor details — the things that might make a 2 percent difference, but mostly distract you from the real work that would make 80 percent of the difference.</p>

    <p>When you eliminate everything that is unnecessary, there are no details to hide behind. You’re left with just the basics and whether or not you have mastered them.</p>

    <p>As you'll see throughout this guide, a minimalistic approach can be applied to consumption, goals, schedules, tasks, design, and much more.</p>

    <h3>Why We Want Things We Don't Need</h3>

    <p>I want to tell you about something called The Diderot Effect to help explain why we want things we don't need.</p>

    <p>The Diderot Effect states that obtaining a new possession often creates a spiral of consumption which leads you to acquire more new things. As a result, we end up buying things that our previous selves never needed to feel happy or fulfilled.</p>

    <p>The effect is named for Denis Diderot, the co-founder and writer of Encyclopédie, who experienced a large windfall of wealth after living nearly his entire life in poverty. Shortly after, Diderot acquired a new scarlet robe. That’s when everything went wrong. </p>

    <p>Diderot’s scarlet robe was beautiful. So beautiful, in fact, that he immediately noticed how out of place it seemed when surrounded by the rest of his common possessions. He soon felt the urge to buy some new things to match the beauty of his robe.</p>

    <p>He replaced his old rug with a new one from Damascus. He decorated his home with beautiful sculptures and a better kitchen table. He bought a new mirror to place above the mantle and his “straw chair was relegated to the antechamber by a leather chair.”</p>

    <p>These reactive purchases have become known as the Diderot Effect.</p>

    <p>You can spot similar behaviors in many other areas of life:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>You buy a new dress and now you have to get shoes and earrings to match.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You buy a CrossFit membership and soon you’re paying for foam rollers, knee sleeves, wrist wraps, and paleo meal plans.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You buy your kid an American Girl doll and find yourself purchasing more accessories than you ever knew existed for dolls.</li>
        <br>
        <li>You buy a new couch and suddenly you’re questioning the layout of your entire living room. Those chairs? That coffee table? That rug? They all gotta go.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Life has a natural tendency to become filled with more. We are rarely looking to downgrade, to simplify, to eliminate, to reduce. Our natural inclination is always to accumulate, to add, to upgrade, and to build upon.</p>

    <h2>How to be a Minimalist</h2>

    <h3>Minimalistic Scheduling</h3>

    <p>Doing more things does not drive faster or better results. Doing better things drives better results. Even more accurately, doing one thing drives better results.</p>

    <p>Mastery requires focus and consistency.</p>

    <p>I haven’t mastered the art of focus and concentration yet, but I’m working on it. One of the major improvements I’ve made recently is to assign one (and only one) priority to each work day. Although I plan to complete other tasks during the day, my priority task is the one non-negotiable thing that must get done.</p>

    <p>Here’s what my current weekly schedule looks like…</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Monday – Write article.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Tuesday – Send two emails (one for networking, one for partnerships.)</li>
        <br>
        <li>Wednesday – Write article.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Thursday – Write article.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Friday – Complete weekly review.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Saturday – OFF</li>
        <br>
        <li>Sunday – OFF</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Minimalistic Goal Setting</h3>

    <p>Your odds of success improve when you are forced to direct all of your energy and attention to fewer tasks.</p>

    <p>If you want to master a skill—truly master it—you have to be selective with your time. You have to ruthlessly trim away good ideas to make room for great ones. You have to focus on a few essential tasks and ignore the distractions. You have to commit to working through 10 years of silence.</p>

    <p>Here's how Warren Buffet recommends people narrow down their goals, as told by Buffett's longtime business partner Charlie Munger…</p>

    <p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 3px solid black; "><mark style="background-color: #fef5df ;"> When Warren lectures at business schools, he says, “I could improve your ultimate financial welfare by giving you a ticket with only 20 slots in it so that you had 20 punches—representing all the investments that you got to make in a lifetime. And once you’d punched through the card, you couldn’t make any more investments at all.” He says, “Under those rules, you’d really think carefully about what you did and you’d be forced to load up on what you’d really thought about. So you’d do so much better.” Again, this is a concept that seems perfectly obvious to me. And to Warren it seems perfectly obvious. But this is one of the very few business classes in the U.S. where anybody will be saying so. It just isn’t the conventional wisdom. To me, it’s obvious that the winner has to bet very selectively. It’s been obvious to me since very early in life. I don’t know why it’s not obvious to very many other people. </mark> </p>

    <h3>Minimalistic Consumption</h3>

    <p>Here are some tips for how to control the Diderot Effect and adopt a minimalist's approach to buying and consuming.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Reduce exposure.</b>Nearly every habit is initiated by a trigger or cue. One of the quickest ways to reduce the power of the Diderot Effect is to avoid the habit triggersthat cause it in the first place. Unsubscribe from commercial emails. Call the magazines that send you catalogs and opt out of their mailings. Meet friends at the park rather than the mall. Block your favorite shopping websites using tools like Freedom. </p>

    <p>
        <b>Buy items that fit your current system.</b> You don’t have to start from scratch each time you buy something new. When you purchase new clothes, look for items that work well with your current wardrobe. When you upgrade to new electronics, get things that play nicely with your current pieces so you can avoid buying new chargers, adapters, or cables.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Set self-imposed limits.</b> Live a carefully constrained life by creating limitations for you to operate within. Juliet Schor provides a great example with this quote…
    </p>

    <p style="padding: 20px; border-left: 3px solid black; "><mark style="background-color: #fef5df ;"> “Imagine the following. A community group in your town organizes parents to sign a pledge agreeing to spend no more than $50 on athletic shoes for their children. The staff at your child’s day-care center requests a $75 limit on spending for birthday parties. The local school board rallies community support behind a switch to school uniforms. The PTA gets 8o percent of parents to agree to limit their children’s television watching to no more than one hour per day. Do you wish someone in your community or at your children’s school would take the lead in these or similar efforts? I think millions of American parents do. Television, shoes, clothes, birthday parties, athletic uniforms-these are areas where many parents feel pressured into allowing their children to consume at a level beyond what they think is best, want to spend, or can comfortably afford.” —Juliet Schor, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0060977582/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0060977582&linkCode=as2&tag=jamesclear-20&linkId=ARG5FQHAAELW2WVJ" target="_blank"> The Overspent American </mark></a></p>

    <p>
        <b>Buy One, Give One.</b> Each time you make a new purchase, give something away. Get a new TV? Give your old one away rather than moving it to another room. The idea is to prevent your number of items from growing. Always be curating your life to include only the things that bring you joy and happiness.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Go one month without buying something new.</b> Don’t allow yourself to buy any new items for one month. Instead of buying a new lawn mower, rent one from a neighbor. Get your new shirt from the thrift store rather than the department store. The more we restrict ourselves, the more resourceful we become.
    </p>

    <p style="border-bottom: 1px solid; padding-bottom: 50px;">
        <b>Let go of wanting things.</b>There will never be a level where you will be done wanting things. There is always something to upgrade to. Get a new Honda? You can upgrade to a Mercedes. Get a new Mercedes? You can upgrade to a Bentley. Get a new Bentley? You can upgrade to a Ferrari. Get a new Ferrari? Have you thought about buying a private plane? Realize that wanting is just an option your mind provides, not an order you have to follow.
